Using the Tynt API Client Library
---------------------------------

The Tynt client requires the 'httparty' gem.  The 'httparty' gem requires
'net/https' which requires libopenssl-ruby to be installed.

The Tynt API is used through the TyntClient class.

Below is a simple example of how to use TyntClient to print out the top Tynt
categories.

require 'tynt_client'

app_id = "your-app-id-from-dev.tynt.com-goes-here"
tynt_client = TyntClient.new(app_id)
result = tynt_client.top_categories
result.each { |category| puts "  " + category['display_name'] }

For this code example to run, you'll need to make sure that the "app_id"
variable is set to a valid Tynt app ID.  If you don't have an app ID yet, you
can get one at dev.tynt.com.

Take a look at the example.rb file for more usage examples of the TyntClient
class.
